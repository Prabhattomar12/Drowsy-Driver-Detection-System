# Drowsy Driver Detection System 
 
 Driver Drowsiness Detection is a safety technology which can be used to prevent automobile accidents which occur usually due to driver being sleepy or drunken driving. A drowsy driver is said to be one of the leading causes amongst the road accidents. Drowsiness occurs due to long continuous driving hours. Long driving hours which exceeds human limits result into tiredness which makes the driver less conscious and sleepy which leads to an accident eventually. It is a complex phenomenon which can have many different sources of origin and also there is no direct method of detecting drowsiness but there exist some indirect ways of drowsiness detection like blinking patterns and eye movement which I will be using to detect a drowsy driver. In this project I will develop a prototype of Drowsiness Driver Detection whose main goal would be to accurately monitor the state of driver’s eye (open or closed) in real time. We can detect the symptoms of driver’s fatigue early enough to avoid an accident by monitoring the eyes of a driver. We can also detect the fatigue of a face by observing the eye movements and blinking pattern.
